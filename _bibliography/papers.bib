  abstract  = {When applied in building rescue, forest search and other missions, UAV swarms often encounter challenges such as narrow space constraints and dynamic changes of obstacles, which leads to internal conflicts in the swarm or cause system chaos due to avoiding dynamic obstacles during the execution of tasks. These rigorous characteristics of the actual application scenarios and tasks always make global searching difficult to be optimized and local obstacle avoidance into deadlock. To solve the above problems, this paper introduces a hierarchical online collaborative planning framework inspired by global spatio-temporal paths. In order to reduce the solution complexity while dissolving the overall conflict, global rough searching is conducted for initial spatio-temporal guidance path. To overcome dynamic obstacles without affecting the system internal harmony, online conflict-trend-based clustering co-optimization inspired by the initial path is performed to achieve obstacle avoidance while improving scalability. Experimental tests were conducted in simulation environments with narrow pipelines and dynamic obstacles with comparison to current mainstream centralized and distributed methods. The results demonstrate that our work can generate smoother and safer trajectories with higher success rate in the constraint-rich dynamic environments.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous driving in urban scenarios faces uncertain dynamic changes, especially in China, where a dense mixture of cars, cyclists and pedestrians travel together on roads with random uncertain behaviors and high-risk road crossing. This paper proposes a Multi-step Continuous Decision Making and Spatio-temporal Trajectory Planning framework to achieve stable continuous decision making and high-quality trajectory planning in such uncertain and highly dynamic environments. Firstly, a 3D spatio-temporal probabilistic map is constructed to represent the uncertain future driving environment. Based on the map, parallel spatio-temporal trajectory search is performed to obtain multi-strategy feasible spatio-temporal trajectories that satisfy the short-term deterministic and long-term uncertain environmental constraints. Then considering the continuity and consistency of decision making, risk-aware rolling-fusion of trajectory sequences is proposed, achieving efficient and exploratory far-end planning with a stable and safe near-end driving trajectory. To validate the proposed framework, we collected the Hard Case data from real Chinese urban roads, containing challenging scenarios such as dense traffic flows, mixed vehicle-pedestrian roads, and complex intersections, which are widely recognized barriers to the successful real-world deployment of autonomous driving. Moreover, the SMARTS simulator is used to build closed-loop simulation scenarios to verify the effectiveness of the framework. Experimental results show the superior performance of our proposed framework in complex uncertain dynamic scenarios.},

  abstract  = {A unified framework for multi-agent task assignment and distributed trajectory planning that can autonomously adapt to complex interactive environments and multi-task constraints has always been the bottleneck of unmanned cluster task. In multi-agent systems such as smart parking lots and smart intersections, tasks are time-varying with dynamically interactive agents, which cause the challenges such as inefficient assignment, spatiotemporal conflict and poor adaptive ability. Focusing on them, this paper proposes a hierarchical framework that combines centralized task assignment module with a multi-agent reinforcement learning based distributed trajectory planning module, which has a good scalability and task adaptability. The benefit of the proposed hierarchical framework is that it utilizes behavioral heuristic of congestion level and planning cost during assignment to motivate the appropriate assignment, which achieve an organic integration of multiple objectives. In terms of spatiotemporal conflicts for multi-agent, a weighted network structure is designed to capture dynamic obstacle information while introducing conflict constraints for collision avoidance policy optimization. Furthermore, in order to cope with changing tasks, re-assignment and re-planning mechanisms are incorporated into the framework, as well as the graph encoding layer which is adaptive to the uncertain tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted in autonomous parking scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the approach in task assignment and path conflict mitigation. Compared with other state of art methods, the task assignment and overall success rates have increased by 12.1% and 6.8%, respectively, with negligible computing time.},
